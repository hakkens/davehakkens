# davehakkens
WordPress theme for the Dave Hakkens Community website

We wanted to have a place online which is truly ours, we are in control. No adds, open-source, build together in the way we want it to be. We started of building this thing, but invite you to help out and share feedback. It's build on Wordpress, we know. Not the best software to build a community on. But we like that it is a language many developers from all over the world speak. WHich makes it easy to work on together. And we are always looking for passionate developers that want to help out improving this place. If you are on of those, reach out to us in the forums at http://davehakkens.nl/community


It's running on Wordpress.
Couple of key plugins we use to make this community happen
- BBpress for the forums
- Buddypress for the community parts
- Mycred for gamification
- GD bbPress Attachments for forum attachments
